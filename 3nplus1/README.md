# An exploration of the 3n  + 1 conjecture

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

* If the number is even, divide it by two.
* If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

Now, form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with
any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the
next.

The 3n + 1 conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1,
regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.
