# Idiot Bayes Classifier

Idiot Bayes classifer written during a train trip to Berlin. Was listening to
a CCC podcast about neural networks, and they were talking about naive bayes.
Wanted to see if I could remember how to do it.

Classify programm code into { go, notgo }.

# Installation

Run the following:

```bash:
make deps
```

Tests should subsequently be green:

```bash:
make test
